# LIRI-Bot

This application uses command line entries in node to operate like a personal assistent.

Utilizing api databases for spotify, omdb, and twitter, you can use Liri to provide information on these subjects.

The user may enter "node liri" followed by the category of the task, then followed by a selection within that category.

The app will then display the information requested.

The commands are: "my-tweets", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says" (which will read from the random.txt file).

If you do not enter the commands properly, the app will remind you what they are.
